# Exploratory Analysis of VGC Restricted Pairs at Pokemon's North America International Championship

Pokemon Video Game Championships (VGC) is the official competitive format for the Pokemon video game series by The Pokemon Company and the [Play! Pokemon](https://www.pokemon.com/us/play-pokemon) program. Derived from the popular Pokemon video game series, the VGC format sees individuals forming teams of six Pokemon to battle other teams in a simultaneous-turn-based contest.

Similar to popular trading card games, individuals are able to form their teams from a wide range of available characters that can be customized as players see fit. The pool of Pokemon that are available to be selected for an individual's team are determined by the current regulation format. As of 7/24/2025, the current regulation format is [Regulation I](https://scarletviolet.pokemon.com/en-us/events/regulation-i/).

Regulation I is known as a "double restricted" format-- allowing each team to include up to two (typically) more powerful restricted special Pokemon. Teams designed for play in double restricted formats are typically designed to support their duo of powerful restricted Pokemon and enable them to take advantage of their strong moves and unique abilities.

In this repository, I aim to perform an exploratory data analysis of restricted duos, gaining insight into their performance and seeing how their teams are constructed.

The data used here come from the most recent Regulation I tournament, the North America International Championship (NAIC) and can be found [here](https://www.pokedata.ovh/standingsVGC/0000149/masters/)
